# DnaStrand
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.
In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell);
you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

# DnaToRna
An RNA string is a string formed from the alphabet containing 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'U'.
Given a DNA string t corresponding to a coding strand, its transcribed RNA string u is formed by replacing all occurrences of 'T' in t with 'U' in u.
Given: A DNA string t having length at most 1000 nt.
Return: The transcribed RNA string of t.
